kancolle-auto was originally a fork of [these](https://github.com/amylase/kancolle-auto) [other](https://github.com/Yukariin/kancolle-auto) [projects/forks](https://github.com/kevin01523/kancolle-auto), but has since outgrown on them in scope and function. Some ideas were inspired by [another similiar tool](https://github.com/tantinevincent/Onegai-ooyodosan).
